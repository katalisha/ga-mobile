///   VARIABLES    ///

//--- let ---//

// `let` is for constants, meaning its value won't change. Ever!

let name = "Brad" // This is good
let otherName = String("Brad") // The String() is not neccesary


let explitlyTypedName:String = "Jess" // Explictly typed, not really neccesary

// Sometimes you don't know the value you need to assign when you create the variable
let nameTobeDefinedLater:String
// Different section of code...
nameTobeDefinedLater = "Barry"


//--- var ---//

// `var` is for when things need to change value
var currentlyLoggedInUserName = "Dan"
// Dan logs out...
currentlyLoggedInUserName = "Sally"

// We can assign the "values" of one variable to another
var x = 10
var y = x
x = 5
y // Y is 10 as `y = x` means "Take the value that x is and assign that vale to y". It doesn't bind y to x's value



//--- Type Casting ---//

//let age = Int("16") //This doesn't work as Swift can't reliably convert any string to a integer
let ageString = String(33) // This is fine as an Integer knows how to convert itself to a string

// Sorting

var pleaseSpamMeDefault = true

// Using ! means you're telling Swift you're 100% sure the boxed value is not nil. This is called "unwrapping" the optional.
// I would caution you using this unless you are 100% sure. Otherwise, use the tools Swift gives you to handle un-boxing of optional values

//--- Optionals in if statements ---//

// This is awkward
if userMiddleName != nil {

//--- Optionals with case statements ---//
